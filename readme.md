## Project Overview

### Intro

Welcome to **Dungeon Escape!** This game is built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Phaser 3**.

You control the hero with your keyboard and move freely in real-time (not turn-based). The goal: Find one of the two keys hidden in three chests, avoid the monsters, and escape through one of the two locked doors!

### Scope

The game is designed to practice JavaScript and Phaser 3 for classic grid-based gameplay:

- Free movement on a grid with walls and paths (no turns)
- Real-time action, not turn-based
- Three monsters wander randomly across the dungeon
- Three chests, only two have keys to open the doors
- Player must find a key, unlock a door, and escape while avoiding monsters
- If a monster catches you, you lose!
- Playable on desktop and mobile
